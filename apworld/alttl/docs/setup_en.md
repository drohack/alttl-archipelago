# A Little to the Left Setup Guide

## Required Software

- [A Little to the Left](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1629520/) on PC.
  The base game is enough. Both DLCs are supported and both are **off by
  default** - see DLC below.
- The A Little to the Left Archipelago mod, from the
  [releases page](https://github.com/drohack/alttl-archipelago/releases).
- [BepInEx 6 for Unity IL2CPP, x64](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be).
  **This is a separate download - the mod release does not include it.** It
  must be BepInEx 6, not BepInEx 5: the game is Unity 2020.3.26f1 / IL2CPP and
  BepInEx 5 will not load it.

## Installing

1. Close the game.
2. Extract **BepInEx** into the game's install folder - the one containing
   `A Little To The Left.exe`. On Steam, right-click the game, then Manage,
   then Browse local files.
3. **Start the game once, wait for the main menu, and quit.** This is not
   optional: BepInEx generates its interop assemblies on that first run and the
   mod cannot load without them. This launch takes noticeably longer than
   usual, and only happens once. You should now have a `BepInEx` folder
   containing `config`, `core`, `interop` and `plugins`.
4. Extract the **mod** release zip into the same game folder, so that the files
   land in `BepInEx/plugins/ALTTLArchipelago/`.
5. Start the game again. The main menu gains an **Archipelago** entry.

**Launch the game with no extra command-line arguments.** Custom launch options
make Steam show a confirmation dialog before the game starts.

## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

Your YAML file contains the settings for your copy of the game. See the
[basic multiworld setup guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en) for more.

### Where do I get a YAML file?

From the [player options page](/games/A%20Little%20to%20the%20Left/player-options),
or from the copy shipped beside the mod in the same release.

### Generating the multiworld

Only whoever generates the seed needs this. Put `alttl.apworld`, from the same
release as the mod, into the Archipelago installation's `custom_worlds/`
folder. Archipelago 0.6.7 or newer is required.

The mod and the apworld carry the same version number and are meant to be used
together, because a version change can move location ids. The mod checks this
when it connects and refuses a seed built by a different version rather than
playing a subtly wrong run.

### Settings worth knowing about

- **Puzzle Count** is how long the run is. The full game is 79; the default is
  70, so the level select's overview strip fits on screen.
- **Puzzles Per Pack** is how many puzzles each Puzzle Pack opens. Every block
  is the same size, including the free opening; only the last is short, because
  a run rarely divides evenly. Read the number as a floor rather than a
  promise: below 5 the run still opens 5, and because a run carries at most 14
  packs, packs of your size that would need more than that all grow together.
- **Mechanic Coverage** is the main variety lever. Some mechanics have no
  procedural generator, so hand-made puzzles are the only way to see them -
  without DLC those are stacking, containers, drawers and jigsaws. This setting
  is how many puzzles are guaranteed for each. It is a floor, not the only
  door: campaign puzzles are also drawn by their own weight, so setting this to
  0 makes those mechanics merely unguaranteed rather than absent.

  Which mechanics are scarce depends on what you enabled, and it works itself
  out: Cupboards and Drawers brings a drawer generator and Seeing Stars a
  jigsaw one, so turning those on takes drawers and jigsaws off the scarce
  list rather than reserving puzzles for something no longer rare.
- **Ability Locks** off makes every mechanic work from the start, leaving the
  packs as the only gate. Puzzles can no longer be partly solved.
- **Event Packs** chooses which seasonal Archive packs may appear. Without DLC,
  jigsaws only exist in event packs, so turning enough of them off drops
  jigsaws from the run and the ability with them.

### DLC

Both DLCs are supported and both are **off by default**. Turn one on only if
you own it.

| Setting | Adds | Solutions |
|---|---|---|
| **Cupboards and Drawers DLC** | 25 puzzles | 32 |
| **Seeing Stars DLC** | 37 puzzles | 100 |

Each has its own weight, on the same relative scale as the generator, event and
campaign weights, deciding how much of the run it fills.

Seeing Stars carries more alternate solutions than the entire base campaign, so
it is the one that changes a **Star Levels** goal most. Five of its puzzles are
locked by the game itself behind a running total of stars; the mod opens those,
so they play like any other slot.

**Only the player needs the DLC.** Whoever generates the multiworld does not,
and other players in the room are unaffected. If you ask for a DLC you do not
have installed, the mod says so when you connect and refuses the seed rather
than handing you a puzzle that will not open.

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

1. Start the game and choose **Archipelago** from the main menu.
2. Fill in the three fields: **Server** (the host and port together, as
   `host:port`), **Slot name**, and **Password** if the room has one.
3. Connect. Your run appears on the level select in place of the campaign.

Your randomized progress is kept separately from your normal save, so playing a
multiworld will not disturb a campaign already in progress.

## Troubleshooting

**The Archipelago option is not on the main menu.** The mod did not load. Check
that `BepInEx/plugins/ALTTLArchipelago/` exists inside the game folder, and
look at `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` for lines from `ALTTLArchipelago`.

**The game hangs on a Steam dialog at startup.** Custom launch options are set.
Clear them and start the game normally.

**Connecting is refused over a version mismatch.** The seed was generated by a
different version of `alttl.apworld` than the mod you have installed. Install
the matching pair - both ship in the same release.
